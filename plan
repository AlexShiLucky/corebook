Background:

I've had this idea of writing a book on Core, fully current for one release, with chapters 
describing the internals, some on projects to use Core for, some focusing on boot time etc. 
I was thinking both the pdf and ascii sources would be freely available online, dead tree 
version available at some cost.

My schedule is fairly full for this year, so it'll probably get started next year.


Initial section divide:

Part I - intro, basic use
Part II - advanced use
Part III - internals
Part IV - project topics (chapters on how to do a specific setup)



-----------

I'm envisioning Part IV as a collection of use cases, supplied by users describing their own 
systems in some detail?  A general purpose desktop, a samba server, a web server, a portable 
boot device, etc etc etc.

If its not too far out of scope, I'd be interested in a PART V describing some of the 
remixes that are out there... not so much for the creators of such to tout their own 
distribution but to describe the "why" and the "how" of remastering.  Maybe enlist Svolli, 
JLS, Grandma and/or some others it they are willing?  And including personal, undistributed 
remasters, again assuming a willing author can be found.

Chapters or sections pertaining to very new hardware (missing drivers and such) and very old 
hardware (can't boot from USB, low memory and such) would probably be of interest.
