Extension install scripts
-------------------------

Extensions may optionally include a script to be run after they're loaded.
This is often used to make a default configuration file writable, or to work around some 
application that doesn't recognize its plugins if they are symlinks instead of real files.

These install scripts live in the */usr/local/tce.installed* directory. They are named after 
the extension's file name, so for *myext-foo.tcz* the install script needs to be named 
*myext-foo*.

Install scripts run as root.

The install scripts should be owned by *tc:staff* and have executable permissions. The 
*tce.installed* directory should be owned by *root:staff* and have *775* permissions.

WARNING: Faulty permissions for the *tce.installed* directory may break extension loading.

Example: nano
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For an example, let's take a look at what kind of install script would be needed for the 
nano editor.

Nano ships with a system-wide default configuration file. If the user loads the nano 
extension to RAM, the file will be writable, and nothing needs to be done; but what about 
the other case, default mounting?

In that case, the file would be a symlink to a read-only file, not what we want. So in the 
install script, we need to detect if the configuration file is a symlink, and if so, copy 
the real file in its place.

As the install scripts are run before the backup is restored, we never overwrite any custom 
configuration the user has done.

# If the config file is a symlink,

# This is a no-op on copy2fs installs.
