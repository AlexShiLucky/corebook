Including extensions in the ISO
-------------------------------

This chapter will introduce the method of including extensions in an ISO image.

The Tiny Core and Core Plus ISOs are examples of this method - a bare Core plus extensions 
on the disc.

Since a CD is read-only, most of the operations you can perform on a normal *tce* directory 
cannot be done. For this reason, the directory is renamed *cde* when included in an ISO 
image.

The specifics of directory structure are exactly the same as for the *tce* directory.

Example: including nano
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since this example involves downloading dependencies, it's easiest to do on Core itself. 
Install advcomp.tcz and mkisofs-tools.tcz for the required programs.

First, copy the contents of the source ISO image:

[source,sh]
----
$ sudo mkdir /mnt/tmp
$ sudo mount TinyCore-current.iso /mnt/tmp -o loop,ro
$ cp -a /mnt/tmp /tmp/newiso
$ sudo umount /mnt/tmp
----

Download nano into your *tce* directory:

[source,sh]
----
$ tce-load -w nano
----

Copy nano and its dependencies to the *cde* directory, to be placed in the new ISO image:

[source,sh]
----
$ cd /etc/sysconfig/tcedir/optional
$ tce-fetch nano.tcz.tree
$ for file in `cat nano.tcz.tree`; do
$	cp ${file}* /tmp/newiso/cde/optional
$ done

# Add it to onboot.lst, so it gets installed on boot.
$ echo nano.tcz >> /tmp/newiso/cde/onboot.lst
----

Create the ISO image, ready to be burned or booted in a virtual machine:

[source,sh]
----
$ cd /tmp
$ mkisofs -l -J -r -V TC-custom -no-emul-boot \
  -boot-load-size 4 \
  -boot-info-table -b boot/isolinux/isolinux.bin \
  -c boot/isolinux/boot.cat -o TC-remastered.iso newiso
$ rm -rf newiso
----

When you boot this new ISO image, the nano editor will be available for use (installed on 
boot from the image).
