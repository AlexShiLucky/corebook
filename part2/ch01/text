Remastering
-----------

Remastering is the process of editing the initrd image. Producing a new ISO image is not 
necessary, but is often useful if you intend to burn the result to a CD or to test easily in 
a virtual machine.

This chapter covers the process of remastering manually. There exists a helper extension, 
EZRemaster, but that one will not be covered here.

You typically only need to remaster if you need to edit any of the boot scripts, or if 
intending to create a stand-alone image for a specific deployment that runs entirely in RAM.
As updating a remastered image to a newer Core version can be a hassle, a method for that is 
covered in the next chapter.

Pre-requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need a Linux distribution with the required programs available: cpio, tar, gzip, advdef, 
and mkisofs. This need not be Tiny Core itself, but remastering inside Tiny Core is the most 
tested option.

For remastering on Core, install the extensions advcomp.tcz and optionally mkisofs-tools.tcz 
if creating an ISO image.

Unpacking
~~~~~~~~~

First, we'll extract the kernel and initrd image from the latest Core ISO.

[source,sh]
----
$ sudo mkdir /mnt/tmp
$ sudo mount TinyCore-current.iso /mnt/tmp -o loop,ro
$ cd /mnt/tmp
$ cp boot/vmlinuz boot/tinycore.gz /tmp
$ sudo umount /mnt/tmp
----

If you are going to create an ISO image, instead of copying only these two files, copy 
everything:

[source,sh]
----
$ sudo mkdir /mnt/tmp
$ sudo mount TinyCore-current.iso /mnt/tmp -o loop,ro
$ cp -a /mnt/tmp/boot /tmp
$ mv /tmp/boot/tinycore.gz /tmp
$ sudo umount /mnt/tmp
----

With the files copied into /tmp, we'll be unpacking the initrd image next.

[source,sh]
----
$ sudo mkdir /tmp/extract
$ cd /tmp/extract
$ zcat /tmp/tinycore.gz | sudo cpio -i -H newc -d
----

Please note the use of sudo where needed; root rights are required to preserve permissions 
correctly. If your host distribution sets non-default flags for */tmp*, you may also need to 
change the permissions of the */tmp/extract* directory - it needs to be *root:root 755* in 
order to produce a bootable image.

Now, with the initrd image laid bare before our eyes, feel free to do any edits, additions, 
or removals needed.

Packing
~~~~~~~

With the modifications done, these steps create the initrd image from the extracted 
directory tree:

[source,sh]
----
$ cd /tmp/extract
$ sudo find | sudo cpio -o -H newc | \
  gzip -2 > ../tinycore.gz
$ cd /tmp
$ advdef -z4 tinycore.gz
----

The image is compressed using gzip's level 2 to save time. Advdef is used to re-compress the 
image with a slightly better implementation, producing a smaller image that is faster to 
boot.

Creating an ISO image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following commands create a bootable ISO image, ready to be burned or booted in a 
virtual machine:

[source,sh]
----
$ cd /tmp
$ mv tinycore.gz boot
$ mkdir newiso
$ mv boot newiso
$ mkisofs -l -J -r -V TC-custom -no-emul-boot \
  -boot-load-size 4 \
  -boot-info-table -b boot/isolinux/isolinux.bin \
  -c boot/isolinux/boot.cat -o TC-remastered.iso newiso
$ rm -rf newiso
----
