Creating a personal (data) extension
------------------------------------

When you have a set of unchanging data that needs to be stored outside your home directory, 
it's recommended to create an extension out of it rather than add it to the backup (where it 
would add to your boot and shutdown times).

The extension completely mirrors the resulting file system tree, so that if we want to see 
*/usr/share/mydir*, our extension should contain *usr/share/mydir*.

For an example, say you downloaded an icon theme from *gnome-look.org*. Icon themes should 
be installed to */usr/share/icons/name* for a system-wide installation. It's a great example 
of this type of data: unchanging, and needs to be outside the home directory.

First, we'll create the tree we want to see inside the extension, in a temporary directory.
We'll do this as root, so that system directories get the proper permissions and ownership.

[source,sh]
----
$ sudo su
$ cd /tmp
$ mkdir myextension
$ cd myextension
$ mkdir -p usr/share/icons
----

Then, assuming the icon theme was unpacked to /tmp/gold (containing */tmp/gold/16x16* and 
other icon directories), move it to the proper place:

[source,sh]
----
$ sudo su # Still as root
$ mv /tmp/gold /tmp/myextension/usr/share/icons
----

Now we're ready to create an extension out of this directory tree. If you haven't already 
loaded the *squashfs-tools-4.x.tcz* extension, do so now.

[source,sh]
----
$ cd /tmp
$ mksquashfs myextension myicons.tcz
----

[NOTE]
===============
Our mksquashfs has been changed to use custom defaults. If using a mksquashfs binary from 
elsewhere, you need to add the options *-b 4k -no-xattrs* for the same result.
===============

Your personal extension is now ready. All it takes now is to move it to your *tce* 
directory, and to set it as OnBoot (if you need it every boot).

[source,sh]
----
$ cd /tmp
$ mv -v myicons.tcz /etc/sysconfig/tcedir/optional

# Adding it to onboot.lst. Skip if you want it
# OnDemand or not in any list at all
# (manual loading only)
$ cd /etc/sysconfig/tcedir
$ echo myicons.tcz >> onboot.lst
----

You can install it right now with *tce-load -i myicons*, or you can reboot to test whether 
it gets properly loaded on boot. Once the extension is loaded, you should see the 
icons in */usr/share/icons*, and be able to use them in apps.
