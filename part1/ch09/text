Virtualization - Core as a guest
--------------------------------

Most virtual machines default to emulating actual, common hardware. Core should run directly 
on any of those. However, some default to server hardware, and many have special 
virtualization-only hardware that can improve performance. This chapter explores these 
gotchas.

Qemu / KVM
~~~~~~~~~~

The premier open source virtualization solution, KVM, runs Core splendidly. There's built-in 
support for most of the virtio drivers, helping the virtual machine reach faster 
performance.

To make use of the virtio network card, add *-net nic,model=virtio -net user* to your Qemu 
command line. If you have a special network setup (other than user), don't add the *-net 
user* part.

To use a virtio disk, instead of the common *-hda 'file'*, the syntax is
*-drive file='file',if=virtio,media=disk*. Use *media=cdrom* for ISO images instead.

The default options to adjust the assigned RAM and CPU cores work fine; *-m 256 -smp 4* 
would give the VM 256 megabytes of RAM and four cores.

The absolute pointer mode, enabled via *-usb -usbdevice tablet*, does not work perfectly 
with Xvesa, but works fine when using Xorg.

Virtualbox
~~~~~~~~~~

Virtualbox shares some code with Qemu, and it can also use the virtio network and block 
drivers; enable them from the settings.

The mouse support in Virtualbox 4 is currently broken with Xvesa as far as we know; using 
Xorg or Virtualbox 3 instead are workarounds.

VMWare
~~~~~~

VMWare's virtualized network card and SCSI card are supported (vmxnet3 and pvscsi). However, 
VMWare defaults to an emulated SCSI card, whose support is not built-in, but included in the 
*scsi* extension. In order to load extensions from a SCSI drive, one would need to create a 
remaster that includes the SCSI drivers, or to have a two-step boot with the SCSI drivers on 
an IDE disk.

The best way is to choose the paravirtualized network and SCSI card though, as they will 
work directly.

HyperV
~~~~~~

Microsoft HyperV Linux support was still quite unstable during the time of Core 4.x; it is 
not supported. HyperV is supported in the coming 5.x versions.
