Managing extensions
-------------------

This chapter will detail the options under the Maintenance menu in Apps.

MD5 checking
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option allows you to do a corruption check for downloaded extensions. Many types of 
corruption are detected when trying to install an extension, but for some types, or 
extensions not installed, it can be useful to do a manual check.

Check for orphans
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Orphans are extensions not found in the repository. They may have been removed for various 
reasons, or they may be custom extensions not submitted to the repository.

You aren't required to take any action in case an extension was removed from the mirrors; if 
it works for you, you can continue to use it, but no updates will be coming.

Dependencies and deletions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This mode lets you view various reports on the dependencies of all extensions present in the 
tce directory. Some may require the reporting database to be build, those will be greyed out 
until the helper database is built.

One function in particular, update dep files, is occasionally needed. Occasionally there's 
server-side reorganization of the dependencies, or an extension may be renamed, requiring 
you to update the dependency files to avoid inconsistencies. After updating the .dep files, 
it's recommended to use the "Fetch missing dependencies", in case a dependency was added, or 
an extension was renamed.

The other function, extension deletion, allows you to mark an extension to be deleted on the 
next reboot. All of their dependencies that aren't needed by anything else will also be 
removed.

Check onboot unneeded
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option analyzes your onboot.lst to see if there are any redundant items. For example, 
gtk2 is a dependency of Firefox, so if you listed both gtk2 and Firefox, gtk2 would be 
redundant.

Having a compact list without such redundancies helps boot time.

Onboot/ondemand maintenance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These two modes allow you to add and remove extensions from the onboot or ondemand lists. 
This comes in handy if you earlier chose to have an extension be on demand, but now it would 
make more sense to load it on boot, for example.

Onboot.lst is a plain text file, so you can edit it with an editor of your choice in 
addition to the GUI method listed. Ondemand items are generated scripts, so managing them 
manually is discouraged.
