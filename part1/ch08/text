Installing
----------

A Core install consists of three parts: a bootloader on some media, the main image 
(kernel and *core.gz*) on some media, and the *tce* directory on some media.

While these can all be on the same disk, they need not be; all three can be on separate 
media if needed.

With the official installer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The official installer is included in the CorePlus edition, but can also be downloaded 
separately to install from a TinyCore or a command-line Core image (*tc-install.tcz*).

The command-line version, *tc-install.sh*, is not covered here, but it follows the same 
prompts as the graphical version.

Manually

From Windows via core2usb
