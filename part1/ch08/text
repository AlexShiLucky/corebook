Installing
----------

A Core install consists of three parts: a bootloader on some media, the main image 
(kernel and *core.gz*) on some media, and the *tce* directory on some media.

While these can all be on the same disk, they need not be; all three can be on separate 
media if needed.

[TIP]
=========
A Core install is completely nomadic, it doesn't read any settings from the install system.

This means you can install to a drive on one system, and then move the drive to the target 
system without any issues. This is useful for example for laptops that can't boot from CD or 
USB.
=========

With the official installer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The official installer is included in the CorePlus edition, but can also be downloaded 
separately to install from a TinyCore or a command-line Core image (*tc-install.tcz*).

The command-line version, *tc-install.sh*, is not covered here, but it follows the same 
prompts as the graphical version.

The GUI installer is a five-step process.

Step 1: Source and destination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the first step, we need to select the install media, install type, and the target.
The installer may be able to detect the install media automatically as in this image; if 
not, click on the "Path to core.gz" text field to browse for the install media.

The three install types are frugal, USB-HDD, and USB-ZIP. Frugal is the default type, it may 
be installed to a partition, and usually works for bootable USB sticks too. USB-HDD uses the 
whole disk and slightly different formatting, which may help the USB stick boot on 
computers it otherwise wouldn't. USB-ZIP is for older BIOSes that needed ZIP-drive emulation 
in order to boot from USB.

If this is the only linux system on the computer, select "Install boot loader" and "Mark 
partition active" (the latter only if not using the whole disk).

Step 2: File system type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here we select the formatting, defaulting to ext4.

Step 3: Boot codes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to enter any boot codes, this is the place. By default you don't need any.

NOTE: You can change these later by editing the bootloader config file.

Step 4: Optional parts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This page is only visible when installing from the Core Plus image. You can choose to 
install some useful extensions here. They can be installed afterwards too, this choice is 
not special or unreversible.

Step 5: Good to go?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the final step, the installer lets us review the choices before starting. If everything's 
in order, click Proceed.

The installer will happily chug away, and assuming nothing out of place happens, you'll see 
a success screen like this one.

From Windows via core2usb
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Core Team member bmarkus created a simple USB installer for Windows users. It's not 
recommended to 
use third-party installers such as LiLi or Unetbootin, as they won't create the third part 
of the install (the *tce* directory), meaning more work for you.

This utility is available from http://core2usb.sf.net/. If you don't want to burn a CD, it's 
a convenient one-click way to install Core to USB.
