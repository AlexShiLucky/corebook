Basic package management via CLI
--------------------------------

In this chapter we'll go over the basic use of the command line equivalent to Apps, 
*tce-ab*, and the direct interface, *tce-load*.

Starting tce-ab, we are greeted with a line-based interface:
indexterm:[tce-ab]

[source,sh]
----
$ tce-ab
tce-ab - Tiny Core Extension: Application Browser

S)earch P)rovides K)eywords Q)uit:
----

The three search options are the same as with the Apps program (note that keywords = tags).

For example, doing a keyword search for "browser", we are greeted with a list of extensions 
with a matching tag. Selecting the number of the extension fires up the extension's info 
file in the *less* viewer.

After having read the info file and pressing 'q', tce-ab gives us a set of choices on what 
to do with it:
[source,sh]
----
A)bout I)nstall O)nDemand D)epends T)ree F)iles siZ)e \
L)ist S)earch P)rovides K)eywords Q)uit:
----

About brings us back to the info file, install and ondemand have the same functions as with 
Apps, as do depends, files and size. Displaying the tree file will show the recursive chart 
of dependencies, used by the size function to calculate the necessary download size.

List will return us to the selection list, and the search options will let us to do a new 
search.

tce-load
~~~~~~~~

Tce-load is the non-interactive tool used behind the scenes by the boot process, Apps, and 
tce-ab.
indexterm:[tce-load]

Running it with the help option gives us a short overview of what it does:
[source,txt]
----
$ tce-load -h
Usage: tce-load [-i -w -wi -wo -wil -ic -wic -wicl]{s} \
extensions
  -i   Loads local extension
  -w   Download extension only
  -wi  Download and install extension
  -wo  Download and create an ondemand item
  Adding -c to any -i option will force a one time \
	copy to file system
  Adding -l to any -i option indicates load only - \
	do not update onboot or ondemand
  Adding -s to any option will suppress OK message \
	used by apps GUI

Example usage:
 Load local extension:
   tce-load -i /mnt/hda1/tce/optional/nano.tcz
 Download into tce/optional directory, updates OnBoot
 and installs:
   tce-load -w -i nano.tcz
 Download only into tce/optional directory:
   tce-load -w nano.tcz
----

For example, if we already know the name of the extension needed, we can ask for it to be 
downloaded and installed (the OnBoot mode):

[source,sh]
----
$ tce-load -wi ace-of-penguins
----

The tool will operate in the set *tce* directory, so unless given full path, it will look 
there first. Suppose we had selected "Download only" for Ace of Penguins before, and thus it 
was not installed for this session. We could install it with:

[source,sh]
----
$ tce-load -i ace-of-penguins
----

[TIP]
========
Just like most Core tools, tce-load and tce-ab are shell scripts.
As far as package managers go, they are fairly simple and easy to understand.

You are encouraged to look under the hood.
