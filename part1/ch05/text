Updating the base system
------------------------

As new minor and patch versions are released, for example 4.7 and 4.7.1, how do we update to 
the latest core?

The process is usually as simple as downloading the latest vmlinuz and core.gz, and 
replacing them on your boot media. This can be done live from the system, as Tiny Core boots 
to RAM, and so you can operate on the boot files in any way you wish.

After a reboot, you will be running the latest core code. To check the running version, you 
can run the *version* command:

[source,sh]
----
$ version
4.7.5
----

It is important to review the release notes for any items in your backup that may need to be 
updated. Often there are tweaks to the user files such as .profile, which you may have 
customized to your needs; any such files are mentioned in the release notes.

The latest pristine copies of any user files can be found in */etc/skel*. If you have 
customized some of the files, please compare the latest copy with your version to see if any 
changes need to be done.

With the base system updated, it's recommended to update extensions next.
