Core concepts
-------------

NOTE: This chapter is an edited version of the one available on our web page.

On behalf of the Tiny Core Team, welcome. Please take the time to read this document and 
understand the philosophies behind Tiny Core. 

One quick user beware: Tiny Core is not a turn-key operating system. At least initially, 
almost all users will require internet access to the online repository. 

Philosophies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a quick summary, Tiny Core
loads itself into RAM from storage, then mounts applications on storage, or installs 
applications to RAM from storage. An extension is said to be 'loaded' or 'installed'
regardless of the method used (mount vs. copy to RAM).

Tiny Core is different because users are not encouraged to perform a 'traditional', 
hard-drive installation of the operating system. Sure, a hard drive installation is 
possible, but Tiny Core is designed to run from a RAM copy created at boot time. Besides 
being fast, this protects system files from changes and ensures a pristine system on every 
reboot. Easy, fast, and simple renew-ability and stability are principle goals of Tiny 
Core. 

If this sounds similar to what many live CDs do, the techniques are indeed similar and 
shared.

Frugal install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Frugal is the typical installation method for Tiny Core. That is, it is not a traditional 
hard drive installation, which we call "scatter mode", because all the files of the system 
are scattered all about the disk. With frugal, you basically have the system in two files, 
*vmlinuz* and *core.gz*, whose location is specified by the boot loader.
indexterm:[frugal install]

Any user files and extensions are stored outside the base OS.

Boot codes
~~~~~~~~~~

Depending upon how Tiny Core is installed (GRUB, LILO, CD, USB stick ...), users have 
the option to use boot codes on each reboot (CD, etc), or to store those codes in a boot 
configuration file (GRUB, LILO, etc.).

Boot codes (boot arguments) affect how Tiny Core operates by defining options at boot-time. 
There are lots of boot codes. To view all the available options, peruse the boot code lists 
by pressing F2, F3 or F4 at the CD boot prompt.

The boot code *base* is notable. Use *base* to simulate the default mode and skip all 
application extension installing or mounting. This is a useful tool for troubleshooting, extension 
building, upgrading ... and just checking out how fast Tiny Core can boot on your hardware. 

USB and other external storage devices' special requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tiny Core can be instructed to search for data on external devices at boot time:
a USB pen drive, compact flash, or other portable media. This need not be the boot media;
in fact, for example it is common to store user data on a hard disk, while booting from cd 
or USB.

Sometimes, hardware doesn't wake up fast enough for Tiny Core's boot sequence, though. If 
the hardware doesn't wake up in time, Tiny Core will move on and finish booting without that 
data.

If you store data on external/slow media, it may be necessary to use the boot code 
*waitusb=5* or similar. This pauses the boot process for five seconds, waiting 
for 
slow devices to register with the system bus. 

Dependency checking and downloading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tiny Core makes application-getting as easy as possible. The Apps tool provides application 
details from individual .info files - this is enlightening reading material when choosing 
applications. Always read the .info files, and re-read them before upgrading to catch 
changes and concerns.

Dependencies are the pieces (other applications, libraries) required for an application. In short, the 
Tiny Core Apps tool will take care of downloading and checking dependencies for you. 

Modes of operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The modes of operation mix up how Tiny Core loads, mounts, and installs at boot time (see 
philosophies, above, if you want to clarify what those three things mean here). Tiny Core 
has three main modes:

- Default mode: cloud/internet 
- Mount mode: TCZ/install 
- Copy mode: TCZ/install + copy2fs.flg/lst

Again, some may say there is a "Traditional mode: install to a hard drive", but that's not 
really a mode at all. If you want to do it, go right ahead. It's just not one of the 
original goals of the project, so expect to keep both pieces if it breaks.

The default mode: cloud/internet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, Tiny Core Linux operates like a cloud/internet client. In default mode:

Tiny Core boots entirely into RAM. 
Users run the Apps tool to browse the repository and download applications. 
Application Extensions (downloaded applications) last only for the current session. 
Tiny Core just uses as much RAM as possible. 

Since Cloud/Internet Mode operates out of RAM, it runs fast. Cloud/Internet Mode is nomadic 
and quick-booting. Application extensions are lost on reboot, but only the system files have 
to be restored.
If you would like applications stored locally and set up on each reboot, then consider the 
mount and copy modes. 

Mount mode
~~~~~~~~~~

This is the most widely used and recommended method for using Tiny Core. 

Applications are stored locally in a directory named *tce* on a persistent store, e.g. a 
supported disk partition (ext2, ext3, ext4, vfat).
Applications are optionally mounted on reboot (see onboot.lst in forum and wiki). 
Mounting applications saves RAM for other uses.

Unless specified with a boot code of *tce=xdyz* Tiny Core will search for and uses the /tce 
directory of downloaded extensions.

Tiny Core uses the Apps tool to place application extensions in this tce/ directory and 
to flag them as 
either "OnBoot" (mount at boot) or "On Demand" (do not mount at boot, but create a special 
menu section for easy access and display an icon if available).

Copy mode
~~~~~~~~~

The copy mode is a modification of the mount mode.

Selected application extensions are copied into RAM instead of mounted. 
Applications can be RAM-loaded in bulk (copy2fs.flg), selectively loaded into RAM 
(copy2fs.lst), or mounted. 
The Apps program tracks installation/loading options (bulk copy, selective copy, etc). 
Boot times are longer, since copying to RAM takes more time than mounting, but runtime 
speed, especially first start, is greatly faster.

Copy mode briefly extends the boot time to gain some of the RAM-run speed of default mode 
and the persistence of a pure mount mode.

In copy mode, it is important to note that extensions can be either mounted or copied into 
RAM. The Apps program makes this flexibility possible by keeping track of user 
selections. 

It should be noted that using a bulk selection, that is, loading all extensions to RAM, 
allows the storage to be unmounted, and the system to avoid any corruption on power loss.

Backup/restore & other persistence options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Aside from the mount mode and the *tce* directory of application extensions, Tiny Core 
supports persistent/permanent:

- backup and restore of personal settings, and
- persistent /home and /opt directories.

Backup/restore
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tiny Core includes the filetool utility for saving personal settings and data. The text file 
*/opt/.filetool.lst* lists files and directories to be backed up at power down and restored 
at 
reboot. The list may be changed manually (using vi, nano, etc) or via the scripts in the 
Tools menu; note that the entry for */opt/.filetool.lst* should never be removed from the 
list 
itself. Filetool also supports exclusion of particular files via */opt/.xfiletool.lst*.

By default, *filetool.lst* includes the entire home/tc directory, and *xfiletool.lst* 
excludes some unnecessary caches and temporary directories.

Filetool writes the backup file *mydata.tgz*. The location of mydata.tgz can be initially 
set using the 
boot option *restore=hdXY*, *restore=hdXY/directory*, or, after boot, by selecting 
Backup/Restore from the Control Panel. If the restore code is not used, Tiny Core will 
search for *mydata.tgz* in available root directories at boot. Conversely, the boot option 
*norestore* 
ignores any existing backup files, a useful tool for troubleshooting and upgrading.

Further settings and configurations are stored or executed using /home/tc/.xsession, 
/home/tc/.profile, /opt/bootlocal.sh, and /opt.

Persistent home
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Just as Tiny Core offers persistence options for downloaded application extensions, so does 
it for your home directory. These are set using boot codes/options.

The bootcode *home=hdXY* will automatically setup /home/tc to "bind" to /mnt/hdXY/home/tc. 
The home boot code lets Tiny Core coexist with other Linux installations by 
inserting the tc user directory under a pre-existing /home directory. Also, Tiny Core 
cannot auto-detect a persistent home directory, so the home boot option is always required. 

The decision on whether to use the default backup, or to set up a persistent home/opt 
directory depends on the amount of data you intend to save, and the device you use for 
storage (USB flash and SSDs may have limited write cycles, for instance).
