Basic package management via GUI
--------------------------------

The first contact is often the graphical package manager, the Apps tool. You can start it 
from the bottom launcher under the name Apps, or if using an alternate window manager 
without wbar, under the menu.

Let's quickly go over the interface.

The two white main areas are for the content. On the left, once connected, you will have a 
list of packages, while the right panel displays the info you've selected from the four 
tabs.

The tabs are respectively the extension's info file, the list of files in the extension, the 
list of dependencies, and an analysis of the total download size needed.

The dropdown menu on the bottom, currently saying "OnBoot", defines what to do with the 
selected extension. The modes will be covered later on in detail.

The tce bar displays the path to your current *tce* directory. If it's the default (RAM), it 
will be red; if it's on permanent storage, it will be green. The set button to the right 
lets you set the *tce* directory if needed.

The URI bar shows the selected mirror.

The search dropdown menu lets you do three kinds of searches: by name, by tag, and by the 
files it provides.

Finally, the main menu in the upper-left corner defines the mode of action.

To start browsing, click on the Apps menu - remote - browse.

We can browse the full list, or get a list of search results with the upper-right search 
bar. To return to the full list from a search results list, click again on remote - browse.

With Ace of Penguins selected, we are shown the info file by default. If we're interested in 
the files, dependencies, or how much we'd need to download, the tabs are now active.

Let's go on to install it. But with which method?

.Install methods
OnBoot::
	The default method. This extension will be installed, and added to the onboot list, 
	to be mounted on the following boots.
OnDemand::
	A loading script will be generated for this extension. Instead of being loaded on 
	boot, the icon/menu entry for this extension will load the extension when you first 
	need it. +
	This option speeds up your boot time, at the cost of making the first start of the 
	application slower.
Download + load::
	The extension will be downloaded and installed for this session only. If you have 
	set up your *tce* directory, it will reside there, but since it is not added to the 
	onboot list, it will not be loaded after a reboot.
Download only::
	The extension will only be downloaded, nothing more will be done.

Let's pick OnBoot, the default today. Clicking on Go, a download progress window will pop 
up, and soon we're informed that the install succeeded:

Should the install fail (network error, md5sum failure...), you will be informed of the 
issue with a popup.

Let's enjoy a game of penguin FreeCell now ;)
