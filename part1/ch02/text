Basic package management via GUI
--------------------------------

The first contact is often the graphical package manager, the Appbrowser. You can start it 
from the bottom launcher under the name Apps, or if using an alternate window manager 
without wbar, under the menu.

Let's quickly go over the interface.

The two white main areas are for the content. On the left, once connected, you will have a 
list of packages, while the right panel displays the info you've selected from the four 
tabs.

The tabs are respectively the extension's info file, the list of files in the extension, the 
list of dependencies, and an analysis of the total download size needed.

The dropdown menu on the bottom, currently saying "OnBoot", defines what to do with the 
selected extension. The modes will be covered later on.

The tce bar displays the path to your current *tce* directory. If it's the default (RAM), it 
will be red; if it's on permanent storage, it will be green. The set button to the right 
lets you set the *tce* directory if needed.

The URI bar shows the selected mirror.

The search dropdown menu lets you do three kinds of searches: by name, by tag, and by the 
files it provides.

Finally, the main menu in the upper-left corner defines the mode of action.

To start browsing, click on the Apps menu -> remote -> browse.
