Updating extensions
-------------------

Extensions are usually updated more often than the base system.

As extension updates may require some action on your part, it is recommended to view the 
info files of updated extensions before doing the update. The Apps tool will let you do 
that, while the command-line update is a batch one.

In both cases, the updated extensions are stored in a staging directory, and the actual 
update will be applied on the next reboot. This ensures that no running app will be 
interfered by things being changed from under it.

Apps
~~~~

Starting with the GUI update method, fire up Apps, and select Apps - Maintenance - Check for 
updates.

After a short while, Apps will have the left panel populated with all extensions with 
available updates, with the status from the check displayed in the right panel.

If there is a newer Core version available, or some of the extensions have been 
removed from the repository, this information will be shown in the right panel.

Clicking on an item will show that extension's info file: whether the update is just a 
bog-standard version update, or whether some action is required will be visible there.

To select all items for processing, pick the first one, hold shift, and pick the last one.
Clicking on "Process selected item(s)" will start the update.

tce-update
~~~~~~~~~~

Simply running *sudo tce-update* will do a batch update of all extensions.

However, if there is not enough space to store the updated extensions, you will need to do 
an in-place update, which requires a boot with the boot codes *base norestore*. These options 
cause no extensions to be loaded, making it safe to write the files directly.

The script will warn you and exit, if the space is too tight to do a normal update.
