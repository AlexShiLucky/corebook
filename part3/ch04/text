Accompanying extension files
----------------------------

Alongside a typical extension there are a set of meta-data files. Unlike the popular deb and 
rpm formats, the meta-data is not kept inside the archive itself. This allows meta-data 
updates without changing the main archive, which may be several hundred megabytes large.

While extension updates do take advantage of delta downloads via the *zsync* program, the 
amount of data transferred would still be several times larger if the meta-data were included 
in the main extension archive.

The accompanying files are:

- dep: direct dependencies
- info: size, license, author, updates, and usage information
- list: file list
- md5.txt: checksum
- tree: recursive list of dependencies
- zsync: used for delta updates

Dep files
~~~~~~~~~

These are plain text files listing the direct dependencies for the extension. As dependency 
resolution is recursive, these extensions may have dependencies of their own, and so the 
*.dep* files are usually quite small. indexterm:[dep file]

Info files
~~~~~~~~~~

Modeled after the .lsm format used in old software archives, the info file identifies the 
extension and its main properties: size, description, creator, license, and so on. 

Often the comments field includes usage instructions specific to Core, and the change-log 
field may include required actions for the update, so it's advised to read the info file for 
any extension you install/update. indexterm:[info file]

This is a free-form list of files included in the extension. It can be created using *find*, 
*unsquashfs*, or other tools. indexterm:[list file]

Tree files
~~~~~~~~~~

These are files generated by the server, containing a flattened listing of all dependencies 
for the extension. They are available for convenience, and used for functions like the size 
tab in *Apps*, or for copying an extension and all its dependencies.

Zsync files
~~~~~~~~~~~

These are binary files generated by the *zsyncmake* utility. They are hosted server-side to 
enable delta downloads for faster, lower-bandwidth extension updates.
indexterm:[zsync file]

We also host zsync files for the main ISO images, enabling you to download newer versions 
rather quickly and cheaply.
