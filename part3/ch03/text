The tce directory structure
---------------------------

Looking inside the *tce* directory, there are a variety of files: control files in plain 
text, and extensions as compressed archives. In this chapter we'll introduce the meaning and 
format of these control files.

Here's a typical *tce* directory:
[source,sh]
----
.:
firstrun
onboot.lst
ondemand/
optional/
xwbar.lst

./ondemand:
ace-of-penguins

./optional:
ace-of-penguins.tcz
ace-of-penguins.tcz.md5.txt
nano.tcz
nano.tcz.dep
nano.tcz.md5.txt
ncurses-common.tcz
ncurses-common.tcz.md5.txt
ncurses.tcz
ncurses.tcz.dep
ncurses.tcz.md5.txt
upgrade/

./optional/upgrade:
ncurses.tcz
ncurses.tcz.dep
ncurses.tcz.md5.txt
----

Starting from the top level, we have two directories: *ondemand/* for the ondemand scripts 
(they install the extension, and optionally launch the program if one could be identified), 
and *optional/* for keeping the extensions.

The *optional/upgrade/* is a temporary directory, meaning these extension updates were 
downloaded this session, and will be applied on reboot.

This leaves us with the top-level plain text files.

Firstrun
~~~~~~~~

This is an empty marker, whose existence means that the first-run dialog has been run and 
shouldn't be run again. The first-run dialog is run on the launch of *Apps*, asking whether 
you'd like to automatically choose the best mirror available. indexterm:[firstrun]

The mirror chooser utility can be later on launched from the menu, if needed.

Onboot.lst
~~~~~~~~~~

This is the plain text file containing a list of all extensions that should be loaded on 
boot. The files should be listed without paths, and are looked for only in the *optional/* 
directory. indexterm:[onboot.lst]

This file may be managed via *Apps* or via your favorite text editor.

Example onboot.lst file:
[source,sh]
----
nano.tcz
ace-of-penguins.tcz
----

Xwbar.lst
~~~~~~~~~

This file is formatted according to the *wbar* config file format. It lists the blocks that 
should not be included in *wbar*, the zooming quick-launch bar included by default.

Due to the format, it's preferred to edit this file via the *tc-wbarconf* utility, but 
hand-crafted edits are possible. indexterm:[xwbar.lst]

Example xwbar.lst file:
[source,sh]
----
i: /usr/local/share/pixmaps/exit.png
t: Exit
c: exec exittc
----

Ondemand scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you install an extension as OnDemand, a script will be generated for it under the 
*ondemand/* directory. If the extension can be detected as containing a single program, the 
script will also launch the program; if not, it will merely load the extension when called.

If the extension is detected as containing a single icon for the single program, this icon 
will copied to the *ondemand/* directory, and will be shown in *wbar* just like if the 
program were installed on boot. Upon clicking this icon, the generated script is called, and 
the icon is removed, replaced by the application's real icon.

These scripts are included in the window manager's menu whether or not they contain an icon 
or a program.

Example ondemand script:
[source,sh]
----
#!/bin/sh
ondemand -e nano.tcz
