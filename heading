Dedication & thanks
===================

This book wouldn't be possible without Robert Shingledecker, without whom Tiny Core itself 
wouldn't exist.

I would like to thank Richard A. Rost for helpful comments and suggestions.

Preface
=======

This book mainly targets those with some familiarity with Linux, with no fear for the 
command line. A spirit of tinkering is advised, but not necessary.

Reading the chapters in order is not necessary, so feel free to jump to the interesting 
parts directly.

The book is current for the latest stable 4.x for the x86 architecture, 4.7.7 at the time of 
writing, though many of the principles apply to other versions and architecture ports.
